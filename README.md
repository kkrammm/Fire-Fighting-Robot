In real life, fire accidents can happen anytime and anywhere that usually hardly controllable. Fire accidents can damage the buildings, kill human and may cause unpredictable losses. In addition, death not only due to the fire but also from smoke inhalation and toxic gases. Also, the security of home, laboratory, office, factory and building is important to human life.  Thus, the fire security is important to human life. Note that the human is difficult to detect the fire in the location that is hard to reach or see by a human. Moreover, the human also may take a lot of time to extinguish fire due to the fact that finding a water source can be troublesome. Hence, we develop security system that contains a fire protection robot using sensor. The security system can detect abnormal and dangerous fire using sensors and extinguish it. So, this fire fighting robot helps by sensing the fire automatically and it moves to the location and extinguish it. 

In the event of a fire breakout, to rescue people and to put out the fire we are forced to use human resources which are not safe. With the advancement of technology especially in Robotics it is very much possible to replace humans with robots for fighting the fire. This would improve the efficiency of firefighters and would also prevent them from risking human lives. So, in our project we are going to build a Fire Fighting Robot using Arduino, which will automatically sense the fire and start the water pump. This design which extinguishes fire is to be controlled by microcontroller Arduino uno and supported by L293 motor driver which drives to the place and another additional circuit servo which is used to drive the joints. Here we have used three flame sensor which senses/ detects the fire. As soon as it senses, the L293 motor driver which controls the BO motor make a drive to the place where fire is sensed. Then with the help of mini water pump, water is pumped and the fire is extinguished. Thus, it extinguishes the fire without harming the human beings.
