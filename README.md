              In real life, fire accidents can happen anytime and anywhere that usually hardly controllable. Fire accidents can damage the buildings, kill human and may cause unpredictable losses. In addition, death not only due to the fire but also from smoke inhalation and toxic gases. Also, the security of home, laboratory, office, factory and building is important to human life.  Thus, the fire security is important to human life. Note that the human is difficult to detect the fire in the location that is hard to reach or see by a human. Moreover, the human also may take a lot of time to extinguish fire due to the fact that finding a water source can be troublesome. Hence, we develop security system that contains a fire protection robot using sensor. The security system can detect abnormal and dangerous fire using sensors and extinguish it. So, this fire fighting robot helps by sensing the fire automatically and it moves to the location and extinguish it.
